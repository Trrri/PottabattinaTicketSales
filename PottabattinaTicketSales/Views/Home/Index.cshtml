    <h1 class="display-4">Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is a full-fledged ASP.NET MVC web application with all ingredients as a precursor to the Entity Framework.
        You can turn around and later create this as a database application which is the objective. Therefore, understanding the objects and classes and how they interact with other classes and objects in the framework is really important.

    </p>
    <p>
        This application has three contrllers, siz views with a shared layout and five models. In addition, there are models that have constructors, which deserves your special attention and understanding.
